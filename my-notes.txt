##  These are the user stories


    1. Engineer Alice makes branch "search-experiment"
    2. Alice sets up a project for "search-experiment" using this tool
    3. Engineer Bob makes further changes in master
    4. Testers start working on the "search-experiment" project

        ##  why are the testers looking at the search-experiment project in the first place rather than the master branch


## the problem




##  what I need to do:

I need to edit the tool that I have been provided, in order to:

  [front-end]  be able to specify the branch in a particular project

  [back-end] use the github api to compare a project with master

  [front-end] indicate if a project is up to date or not

  [the gist] make sure that the branch is up to date with master before testers work on it.



Check the API to see if the branch is up to date with master
If not up to date, then give warning or disallow testers from working on the branch
